# Project 2 (P2) grading rubric

## Code reviews

- A TA / grader will be reviewing your code after the deadline.
- They will make deductions based on the Rubric provided below.
- To ensure that you don't lose any points in code review, you must review the rubric and make sure that you have followed the instructions provided in the project correctly.

## Rubric

### General guidelines:
- Did not save the notebook file prior to running the cell containing "export". We cannot see your output if you do not save before generating the zip file. This deduction will become stricter for future projects. (-1)
