## Instructions:

In this project, we will focus on types, operators, and boolean logic. To start, create a `p2` directory, and download `p2.ipynb` and `test.py`. Make sure to follow the steps mentioned in [lab-p2](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p2#task-21-download-boolipynb-opsipynb-and-modipynb) to download these files.

You will work on `p2.ipynb` and hand it in. You should follow the provided directions for each question. Questions have **specific** directions on what **to do** and what **not to do**. 

After you've downloaded the file to your `p2` directory, open a terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to that directory. To make sure you're in the correct directory in the terminal, type `pwd`. To make sure you've downloaded the notebook file, type `ls` to ensure that `p2.ipynb` is listed. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter, and get started on the project!

**IMPORTANT**: You should **NOT** terminate/close the session where you run the above command. If you need to use any other Terminal/PowerShell commands, open a new window instead. Keep constantly saving your notebook file, by either clicking the "Save and Checkpoint" button (floppy disk) or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut.

## IMPORTANT Submission instructions:
- Review [Grading Rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f22-projects/-/tree/main/p2/rubric.md), to ensure that you don't lose points during code review.
- You must **save your notebook file** before you run the cell containing **export**.
