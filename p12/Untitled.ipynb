      "<p>Welcome to your first programming course! CS 220 / CS 319 (Data Science Programming I) is a gentle introduction to coding for students outside of Computer Science. Our goal is simple: to write Python code to answer questions about real datasets. CS 220 / CS 319 will require you to practice coding a lot this semester. CS 220 students will complete 13 programming projects. CS 319 students will complete 9 programming projects and work on a self-chosen graduate level project. It's a lot of work, but if you take this course seriously and invest the time, you'll walk away with an incredible new skill: the ability to make computers work on your behalf. Students are required to have access to a laptop with MAC or Windows OS, where they can install Python, in order to complete projects for this course.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t<li>Project grading is <strong>results-oriented</strong>. That means it doesn't matter how much effort you put it; it only matters how well your code works. This means it is essential that your code runs. If we can't run your code for a project, you'll get a zero on that project, because the auto-grader tests will fail. We'll never fix the code for you, and we'll never manually give a better grade for code that \"looks\" almost correct. It is your responsibility to make sure your code clears auto-grader tests.\n",

      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>any collaboration with your project partner</li>\n",
      "<li>doing worksheets with non-project partners</li>\n",
      "<li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that). If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the citation, you're plagiarizing).</li>\n",

      "</ul>\n",
      "<p><strong>Similarity Detection:</strong> of course, with 1000+ students, it's hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions. Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across submissions. Such similarity detection is an active area of Computer Science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the order of their code. We take cheating detection seriously to make the course fair to students who put in the honest effort.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Citing Code:</strong> you can copy small snippets of code from stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them. For example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number from a list of numbers. I might search for \"how to get the median of a list in python\" and find a solution at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python\" target=\"_blank\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.</p>\n",

Regular interaction is: predictable and scheduled interaction with students consistent with the course length (usually at least weekly but more often in a course of short duration). Regular and substantive student-instructor interaction, as defined by the US Department of Education (Within 34 C.F.R. Â§600.2), is always a requirement of UW-Madison for-credit learning activities.

Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [instructors] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.</p>\n",
